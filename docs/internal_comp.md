# 🏆 Alpha Tuning Competition: Survial of the bit-test! 🚀

We need your help in testing out the alpha version of tuning! In this competition, you'll be fine-tuning model-dataset pairs that are passed to your miners.

## 📊 Scoring Criteria

You will be scored on three aspects:
1. Did you fine-tune the model we asked? ✅
2. How low is your loss on the test set? 📉
3. How low is your loss on a synthetic dataset? 🧪

## 🗓️ Competition Schedule

- **Start**: Wednesday, 22nd at 12:00 UTC
- **End**: Saturday at 00:00 UTC
- **Participants**: Up to 20 miners (one person can sub up to 5 miners)

## 🎢 Competition Flow

1. Initially, job-model combinations will be simple - a short introduction to the process with one training job at a time.
2. By Friday, expect multiple jobs to be sent to you simultaneously.

## 🎯 Optimization Areas for Fair Play

The "playing-fair" miner will have two areas to optimize:
a) Choosing training parameters
b) Deciding when to accept or reject an incoming job

## 🕵️‍♂️ Cheating Strategies (Encouraged for Testing)

We also encourage you to attempt to cheat. Some strategies could include:

a) Training once, submitting many times
b) Submitting a pre-trained network that isn't the one we asked you to fine-tune
c) Trying to find the test set and training just on this

⚠️ **Important**: All participants are asked to keep a note of each model they submitted and the strategy they used. This will help us eventually plug any exploits.

## 👨‍💻 Admin Boddin'

My job (WW) over the 3 days will be to try to plug the exploits as we go along without knowing what you're doing.

## 💻 Resources and Submissions

- Each person is allowed up to 4x A100 GPUs
- You can submit up to 5 miners

## 🏅 Prizes

- All participants who submit at least three models will receive 'x' Tao
- 2nd prize: 'y' Tao
- 1st prize: 'z' Tao

Good luck, feel free to hit me with as many questions as possible! 🍀🥇
