# 🏆 Alpha Tuning Competition: Survial of the bit-test! 🚀

We need your help in testing out the alpha version of tuning! In this competition, you'll be fine-tuning model-dataset pairs that are passed to your miners.

## 📊 Scoring Criteria

You will be scored on three aspects:
1. Did you fine-tune the model we asked? ✅
2. How low is your loss on the test set? 📉
3. How low is your loss on a synthetic dataset? 🧪

## 🗓️ Competition Schedule

- **Start**: Wednesday, 22nd at 12:00 UTC
- **End**: Saturday at 00:00 UTC
- **Participants**: Up to 20 miners (one person can sub up to 5 miners)

## 🎢 Competition Flow


1. You'll first ping in the channel (or DM to WW) that you want your miner to be registered with ip details and WW will add your miner to the pool
2. Jobs will then come through to your miner endpoint with an option to accept/reject, if you accept you'll have a fixed time period to complete training and upload your fine-tune (this is all automated so you only need to change the config if wanna play simple)
3.  Initially, job-model combinations will be basic and allocated training times short - a quick introduction to the process with one training job at a time.
4. By Friday, expect multiple jobs to be sent to you simultaneously.

## 🎯 Optimization Areas for Fair Play

The "playing-fair" miner will have two areas to optimize:
a) Choosing training parameters
b) Deciding when to accept or reject an incoming job

## 🕵️‍♂️ Cheating Strategies (Encouraged for Testing)

We also encourage you to attempt to cheat. Some strategies could include:

a) Training once, submitting many times
b) Submitting a pre-trained network that isn't the one we asked you to fine-tune
c) Trying to find the test set and training just on this

⚠️ **Important**: All participants are asked to keep a note of each model they submitted and the strategy they used. This will help us eventually plug any exploits.

## 👨‍💻 Admin Boddin'

My job (WW) over the 3 days will be to try to plug the exploits as we go along without knowing what you're doing.

## 💻 Resources and Submissions

- Each person is allowed up to 4x A100 GPUs
- You can submit up to 5 miners

## 🏅 Prizes

You will be ordered based on the product of your individual quality scores. Average score for a comp (say 4 miners in a comp) will always be 1. So you need to be better than average to gain from entering (in your overal score anyway).

- All participants who submit at least three models will receive 'x' Tao
- 2nd prize: 'y' Tao
- 1st prize: 'z' Tao

Good luck, feel free to hit me with as many questions as possible! 🍀🥇
